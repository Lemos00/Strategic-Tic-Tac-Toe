# Strategic-Tic-Tac-Toe
The strategic version of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe"


# Description:
The game consists of a large Tic Tac Toe game in which each "slot" of it has a smaller Tic Tac Toe game in it.
To win the game, you have to win the smaller Tic Tac Toe games in the slots of the major/big Tic Tac Toe game in the same fashion as the classic version of Tic Tac Toe (line, column or diagonal).

# How to play it:
1 2 3 | 1 2 3 | 1 2 3
4 5 6 | 4 5 6 | 4 5 6
7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9

1 2 3 | 1 2 3 | 1 2 3
4 5 6 | 4 5 6 | 4 5 6
7 8 9 | 7 8 9 | 7 8 9

1) Let's say player 1 starts at slot 1 / board 1 in the major game (shown above). If player 1 marks an "X" at position 3 in that game, player 2 will have to make their play in board 3. If player 2, for example, marks an "O" in position 5 in board 3, then player 1 will make his next play in board 5, and so on.
2) If one of the minor games is won by either player, the game will fill it with "X"'s or "O"'s, depending on which player won that board.
3) If the next play of either player lands on a completed / won board, that player can choose an available board to make their next play on.
